                    <h2>Dogs</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dogs have a sense of time but don’t 
                        understand the ‘concept’ of time. Unlike 
                        humans, dogs don’t have the ability to 
                        create actual measures of time, like the 
                        second, hour, and minute, and they don’t 
                        know how to read clocks. So, telling them 
                        ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do 
                        much, but we understand that you feel like 
                        you have to do it anyway! Dogs are capable 
                        of being trained based on past events, and 
                        can be taught to anticipate future events 
                        based on past experiences. Pavlov’s dogs are 
                        the perfect example of this.

                        The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. 
                        Also called the domestic dog, it is derived 
                        from extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the 
                        modern wolf is the dog's nearest living 
                        relative. Dogs were the first species to be 
                        domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 
                        years ago before the development of 
                        agriculture.

                        cat, (Felis catus), domesticated member 
                        (felid) of the family Felidae. The family is 
                        generally divided between cats from the 
                        subfamily Pantherinae, which roar 
                        (including lions, tigers, and leopards), and 
                        cats from the subfamily Felinae, which purr 
                        instead (including cougars, bobcats, and 
                        domestic cats). According to the latest 
                        research, purring likely stems from a special 
                        pad within the folds of a cat’s vocal cords, 
                        which adds an additional layer of fatty tissue 
                        that enables the folds to vibrate (purr) at 
                        low frequencies. Domestic cats are 
                        characterized by retractable claws, powerful 
                        bodies, acute senses, long tails, and 
                        specialized teeth adapted for hunting prey.
